== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't it work on my site? =

If this plugin is not working for you, this could be due to

* your theme not being built to WordPress standards

Please ask for help on the [plugin support page on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/badger "Badger plugin support page on WordPress.org").

The plugin does work as it is designed to on the sites I have tested it on, however it is not possible for me to test on every available theme and with all combinations of other plugins active, or on all possible server setups. If the plugin is not working for you as you expect it to, please read the documentation carefully to check that you are using it correctly and review any existing topics in the [plugin support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/badger/ "Badger plugin support forum"). You may find an appropriate solution outlined in a resolved topic if someone has already had the same or a similar issue. If you do not find an answer that enables you to solve your issue, please post a new topic on the forum.
